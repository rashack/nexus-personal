					Smart card - The token is stored on your smart card 
  
				<li>
					Token stored in a file - A document with a padlock 
  indicates that the token is stored in the Internal Store 
  
				<li>
					Token stored in a file - A document without a padlock indicates that the token is stored on the computer but not stored in the Internal Store.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</a>
		
		<a name="Managing_Tokens">
			<h1>Managing Tokens</h1>
		
			<p>A token can include one or more digital certificates. Besides user certificates, 
			there can also be one or more CA (Certification Authority) certificates.</p>
			
			<p> 
			 To view the contents of a token either double click on the token in the listview or mark 
			 a token and then select the <i>View</i> option under the Token menu in the menu toolbar.</p>
			
			<p>When right-clicking on the token you can also choose Delete, Change or Unblock password. </p>

			<h2>Password</h2>

			<p><i>John Doe Imported</i></p>
		</a>
		
		<a name="PIN_Management_Wizard">
			<h1>PIN Management</h1>
		
			<p>The function <i>Change PIN</i> under the Token menu in the menu toolbar or using the contextmenu option <i>Change password</i>, available when right-clicking on a token, can
				be used to change the password of a token.</p>
			
			<p>In BankID you can change the PIN code(s) of smart cards and soft tokens 
			 stored either in the Internal Store or in a file. </p>
			
			<p>To change the PIN code, the token must be selected in the list followed by the Change PIN or Change password option. 
				In the follewing dialog the Old PIN followed by New PIN must be entered. You will also need to reenter the new PIN in the Confirm 
			 new PIN text box. </p>
			
			<p>PIN(s) used with smart cards might become blocked if an incorrect PIN 
			 is entered a certain number of times.</p>
	
			<h2>Unblock PIN</h2>
			
			<p>The PIN code may be blocked if the wrong PIN code is entered too many times when trying to authenticate, sign or when changing the PIN code.</p>
						
      <p>Different BankID's support different ways of unblocking the PIN code.<br/> 
      Some support changing of the PIN code when unblocking the card. This is useful if you have the <a href="#PUK">PUK</a> code (BankID Unblocking Key), but have forgotten the PIN code.<br/>
      Others only support unblocking and resetting the PIN code to whatever it was before it was blocked.<br/>
      The methods supported are determined by the issuer and the type of BankID.</p>
      
      <p>Choose the BankID from the list in the main window, right click it and select "unblock PIN".</p>

      <p>
      You will be presented with a dialog that contains a dropdown box where you select the PIN code you want to unblock.<br/>
      The dialog also reflects the unblocking method supported. If your BankID supports both methods (described above) you can choose the one you prefer.
      </p>

			Enter your <a href="#PUK">PUK</a> code (BankID Unblocking Key). If the PIN code needs to be changed when unblocking it, you also have to enter the new PIN code and confirm it by entering it again.
      <p>Click OK to perform the unblocking operation.</p>
		</a>
		
		<a name="Delete_Tokens">
			<h1>Delete Tokens</h1>
		
			<p>To delete a token you need to select one in the list and then chose to right-click and select the <i>Delete</i> option in the context menu or
				by selecting the <i>Delete</i> option under the Token menu in the manu toolbar</p>
		</a>
		
		<a name="Registration">
			<h1>Registration</h1>
		
			<p>As a part of a registration process, you may be asked to enter a Token 
			 name and PIN code. The Token name will be the name that BankID displays 
			 when the user is expected to select a token. The PIN code will be used 
			 to protect the content of the token.</p>
		</a>
		
				<a name="User_authentication">
			<h1>User Authentication</h1>
		
			<p>Tokens can be used to authenticate a user to a secure Web site. BankID 
			 is automatically activated when the user performs an action that requires 
			 authentication, i.e., input of password. The authentication dialog is 
			 shown whenever a user authentication has been requested by an application. 
			 </p>
			
			<p>Other situations handled in a similar way occur:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					when a smart card is to be updated 
  
				<li>		
					when another program requests a certificate.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Depending on the type of web browser, different functions are invoked 
			 when the user tries to access a secure site, e.g. when entering https://&lt;siteaddress&gt; 
			 in the address field. </p>
			
			<p>If Netscape or a Mozilla-based webb browser is used, <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">BankID PKCS#11</span> is invoked.</p>
			
			<p>Normally, but not always, the first dialog box is displayed (optionally) 
			 and you must choose a digital certificate. Then the second dialog box 
			 is displayed and you will have to present the PIN code.</p>
		</a>

		<a name="Signing_Electronic_Documents">
			<h1>Signing Electronic Documents</h1>
		
			<p>To sign the electronic document shown in the message window, you should 
			 select which token/certificate to use, enter the PIN code and click the 
			 Sign button otherwise click Cancel. The data to be signed is displayed 
			 in the signature window if displayed at all. Click the View button to 
			 see the data to be signed in a separate window. The data may also be saved 
			 by clicking the Save button.</p>
		</a>
		
		<a name="Web_Application_Login">
			<h1>Web Application Login</h1>
		
			<p>When a secure Web server requests client authentication, the user will 
			 have to select an authentication certificate and then to present a PIN 
			 code.</p>

			<h5>CA</h5>
			
			<p>Stands for Certification Authority. It can be any trusted central administration, 
			 which issues certificates and that is willing to guarantee the identity 
			 of those who receive them and their association with a given key. It can 
			 be, for example, a government-run agency or bank. </p>
			
			<h5>CA Certificate</h5>
			
			<p>A certificate for the public key of a CA. </p>
			
			<h5>CA Key</h5>
			
			<p>RSA key pair generated for the CA. </p>
			
			<h5>Cache</h5>
			
			<p>A temporary storage area for frequently or recently accessed data. In 
			 terms of browser security, the keys are "cached". This means 
			 that those keys that allow you to access secure servers are temporarily 
			 stored in memory for easy retrieval. </p>
			
			<h5>Card</h5>
			
			<p>See "Smart Card". </p>
			
			<h5>Card Reader</h5>
			
			<p>A hardware device used to read smart cards. </p>
			
			<h5>Cipher Text</h5>
			
			<p>Data that has been encrypted and is unreadable until it has been decrypted 
			 with a key. </p>
			
			<h5>Certificate</h5>
			
			<p>A certificate is equivalent to a digital identification card and contains 
			 a unique code for the specified user, where the main purpose is to verify 
			 that the user sending a message is the one he or she claims to be. </p>
			
			<h5>Certification Authority</h5>
			
			<p>See "CA". </p>
			
			<h5>Client Authentication</h5>
			
			<p>The process of verifying a claimed identity, via the protocol SSL. </p>
			
			<h5>Cryptography</h5>
			
			<p>The act of transforming data (see "Encryption") into an unreadable 
			 format. The only way to read the data is by possessing a secret key, which 
			 is usually stored in a token (see also "Token") </p>
			
			<h5>Decryption</h5>
			
			<p>The translation of encrypted data back to its original data by way of 
			 using a password or key (see also "Encryption"). </p>
			
			<h5>Digital Certificate</h5>
			
			<p>See "Certificate". </p>

			<p>The Export function allows you to copy your token to a file in order 
			 to use the token in another computer or to backup the file for safe keeping.</p>
			
			<h5>HTTPS</h5>
			
			<p>The protocol for accessing a secure Web server. Using HTTPS in the URL 
			 instead of HTTP directs the message to a secure port number rather than 
			 the default Web port number. The session is then managed by a security 
			 protocol. </p>
			
			<h5>Import</h5>
			
			<p>The Import function in BankID allows you to import your PKCS#12 digital 
			 identity tokens into the Internal Store. </p>
			
			<h5>Internal Store</h5>
			
			<p>The Internal Store is a Trusted Store offering a higher level of security 
			 than a regular file. Soft tokens should thus be imported into the Trusted 
			 Store unless the higher flexibility of a regular file is needed, e.g. 
			 when moving the file with the soft token between computers.</p>
			
			<h5>Key</h5>
			
			<p>A string of bits used widely in cryptography, allowing people to encrypt 
			 and decrypt data. </p>

			 and decrypting messages. </p>
			
			<h5>Non-repudiation</h5>
			
			<p>In terms of digital security, this is a form of protection that secures 
			 that a payment or transaction has occurred. The transaction cannot be 
			 falsely denied due to the use of a digital signature. </p>
			
			<h5>BankID Identification Number Code</h5>
			
			<p>See "PIN Code". </p>
			
			<h5>PIN Code</h5>
			
			<p>Stands for BankID Identification Number code. When using a token to

			 for messages including cryptographic elements, e.g., digital signatures 
			 and digital envelopes. (Definition taken from "RSA Data Security, 
			 Inc. Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)". Copyright © 1996-1999 
			 RSA Laboratories, a division of RSA Data Security, Inc., a Security Dynamics 
			 Company) </p>
			
			<h5>PKCS #11</h5>
			
			<p>Public Key Cryptography Standard Number 11. Specifies a generic API 
			 to devices (such as smart cards) that hold cryptographic information and 
			 perform cryptographic functions. Thereby, it isolates an application from 
			 the details and type of the cryptographic device. (Definition taken from 
			 "RSA Data Security, Inc. Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)". 
			 Copyright © 1996-1999 RSA Laboratories, a division of RSA Data Security, 
			 Inc., a Security Dynamics Company) </p>
			
			<h5>PKCS #12</h5>
			
			<p>Public Key Cryptography Standard Number 12. Describes a transfer syntax 
			 for personal identity information, and includes private keys, certificates, 
			 miscellaneous secrets, and extensions. Machines, applications, browsers, 
			 Internet kiosks, and so on, that support this standard will allow a user 
			 to import, export, and exercise a single set of personal identity information. 
			 (Definition taken from "RSA Data Security, Inc. Public-Key Cryptography 
			 Standards (PKCS)". Copyright © 1996-1999 RSA Laboratories, a division 
			 of RSA Data Security, Inc., a Security Dynamics Company) </p>
			
			<h5>Public Key</h5>
			
			<p>A key that is known by everyone. In a cryptographic system, two keys 
			 are used, a private and public key. For example, John uses Jane's public 
			 key to send her an encrypted email. Jane uses a private key to decrypt 
			 it. </p>
			
			<a name="PUK"><h5>PUK Code</h5></a>
			
			<p>Stands for PIN Unblocking Key. If a PIN code has been blocked due to 
			 too many attempts, it can be unblocked using the PUK code (if available). 
			 </p>
			
			<h5>Private Key</h5>
			
			<p>A secret key that is only known by the recipient. In a cryptographic 
			 system, two keys are used, a private and public key. For example, John 
			 uses Jane's public key to send her an encrypted e-mail. Jane uses a private 
			 key to decrypt it. </p>
			
			<h5>Smart Card</h5>
			
			<p>A small electronic device about the size of a credit card which contains 
			 an embedded chip with memory. It contains the RSA keys and certificate(s) 
			 needed to authenticate oneself to secure websites and to electronically 
			 sign documents. </p>
			
			<h5>Smart Card Reader</h5>
			
			<p>A hardware device that is used to access the smart card</p>
			
			<h5>Soft Token</h5>
			
			<p>See "Software Token". </p>
			
			<h5>Software Token</h5>
			
			<p>A computer file (as opposed to a smart card) that contains one or more 
			 than one pair of RSA keys and and certificates that are used for encrypting 
			 or digitally signing data. When encrypting or signing, you are required 
			 to enter a PIN code. In BankID the file format can be PKCS#12 or the 
			 Internal store.</p>
			
			<h5>SSL Protocol</h5>
			
			<p>Secure Socket Layer protocol designed and specified by Netscape Communications 
			 Corporation to provide data security layered between application protocols 
			 (such as HTTP, Telnet, NNTP, or FTP) and TCP/IP. </p>
			
			<p>See "The SSL Protocol version 3.0" from Netscape for more 
			 information. </p>
			
			<h5>Token</h5>
			
			<p>A token can either be a card (otherwise known as a "Smart Card") 
			 or a software file (otherwise known as "Software Token") that 
			 contains the RSA keys and certificate(s) used for signing or decrypting 
			 data. When encrypting or signing, you are usually required to enter a 
			 PIN code. </p>
